    "In this project, I'll be working with text data from newsgroup posts covering various topics. The goal is to train classifiers that can categorize these posts based on the topics inferred from the text content. Unlike the digit classification task, where each input is a relatively **dense** 28x28 pixel matrix with many non-zero values, working with text data involves a different representation. Here, each document is represented as a \"bag-of-words,\" which means that only a small subset of words from the entire vocabulary is active in any given document. The assumption underlying this approach is that the topic label depends solely on the count of words in the document, not their order. Throughout this project, I'll explore feature extraction techniques to effectively work with this text data. \n",

To achieve this, we will utilize the `CountVectorizer` along with its `fit_transform` method, nnz, shape attributes, and get_feature_names method.\n",

For this step, we'll utilize `CountVectorizer` with a predefined vocabulary and its transform method.\n",

Next, I will create and assess multiple k-Nearest Neighbors models by varying the parameter k, including one with k set to optimize the f1 score, and for each model, I will display the k value and corresponding f1 score. Similarly, I will generate various Naive Bayes models by adjusting the smoothing parameter (alpha), with one aimed at optimizing the f1 score, and I will record the alpha value and its associated f1 score for each model. Additionally, I will build several Logistic Regression models by modifying the L2 regularization strength (C), including one optimized for the f1 score. For each Logistic Regression model, I will showcase the C value, f1 score, and sum of squared weights for each topic. During this evaluation, I will explore why k-Nearest Neighbors might not perform well for this problem, investigate the reasons behind why Logistic Regression doesn't match the performance of Naive Bayes, and analyze the relationship between the sum of squared weights in logistic regression concerning the C value.\n",

    "* The performance disparity observed with K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) can be attributed to the choice of the Minkowski distance metric in the model. The Minkowski distance metric essentially quantifies the Euclidean distance between data points. However, in this specific context, where we are working with text data and aiming to identify topic similarities, using cosine similarity distance could be more appropriate. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and is particularly effective for text data where the magnitude of the vectors is not as significant as their orientation. By shifting the focus of KNN towards cosine similarity, we can potentially achieve more accurate and generalized results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The varying performance of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes can be understood through their underlying mechanisms and parameter tuning. As the regularization parameter C increases for Logistic Regression and alpha increases for Naive Bayes, their behavior diverges. Logistic Regression essentially attempts to determine the most accurate representation of the four categories by employing four sigmoid functions while selecting from a reduced set of feature vectors as the regularization parameter intensifies. On the other hand, Naive Bayes provides more flexibility for adjusting posterior probabilities with smaller alpha values and less flexibility with larger values. The key distinction lies in how they handle feature selection and model complexity. As C grows in Logistic Regression, it effectively reduces the number of features considered. To potentially enhance Logistic Regression's performance, normalizing the features could be a beneficial step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The relationship between Logistic Regression's C value and the sum of squared weights is intriguing. As the C value in Logistic Regression increases, so does the sum of squared weights. This phenomenon arises because higher C values encourage the model to retain more variables during the regularization process. Consequently, there are more squared weights associated with these variables, leading to a larger sum of squared weights. Essentially, the model becomes less constrained, allowing it to incorporate more features into the decision-making process. Understanding this relationship is essential for fine-tuning the Logistic Regression model, as it helps control the trade-off between model complexity and regularization."

    "1. **Feature Extraction**: Begin by transforming the text data into a matrix of word bigram feature vectors. This matrix will serve as the foundation for subsequent analysis. For this task, I intend to utilize a Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Weight Analysis**: Next, I will focus on understanding the significance of these features within each topic. For each topic, I will identify the 5 features with the largest weights, considering the raw weights (not absolute values). If there are no feature overlaps among topics, this step will yield a total of 20 distinctive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weight Visualization**: To gain deeper insights, I will create a structured table to visualize these feature weights. This table will consist of 20 rows, representing the features (words) identified, and 4 columns, each corresponding to one of the topics. Each cell in this table will display the weight of a particular feature for all topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyzing Surprising Features**: Finally, I will engage in an exploratory analysis by examining this feature-weight table. The goal is to identify any unexpected or intriguing patterns among these features. This step involves qualitative assessment and hypothesis generation based on the feature weights' distribution across topics.\n",

    "### Pre-processing for text\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve generalization, it is common to try preprocessing text in various ways before splitting into words. For example, I could try transforming strings to lower case, replacing sequences of numbers with single tokens, removing various non-letter characters, and shortening long words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Todo:\n",
    "1. Produce a Logistic Regression model (with no preprocessing of text). **I may need to override the \"default\" preprocessing with an identity function**. Evaluate and show its f1 score and size of the dictionary.\n",
    "1. Produce an improved Logistic Regression model by preprocessing the text. Evaluate and show its f1 score and size of the vocabulary. I will aim for an improvement in f1 score of 0.02. **Note: this is actually very hard**.\n",
    "1. How much did the improved model reduce the vocabulary size?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    " - Look at default pre-processing done.\n",
    " - Removing stop words.\n",
    " - Experiment with different ways of getting rid of apostrophe's such as replacing them with spaces or with empty strings.\n",
    "  - Lower casing.\n",
    "  - Including both lowercase and original case versions of a word.\n",
    "  - nltk functions such as stemming.\n",
    "* Train on the \"transformed\" training data, the data after I applied pre-processing.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data. Note that I never want to \"learn\" anything from the dev data.\n",
    "* Use `CountVectorizer(preprocessor=...)` to preprocess strings with your own custom-defined function.\n",

    "### L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths:\n",
    "* Train a Logistic Regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* Reduce the vocabulary to only those features with at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "* Train a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and L2 regularization strength set to 0.5.\n",
    "* Evaluate and record the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a plot of f1 score vs. the logarithm of vocabulary size. Each point on the plot corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze and compare the performance of models based on reduced vocabularies with that of a model based on the full vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",
    "* Use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* Use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* Use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",
    "* (solver=\"liblinear\" might be needed for it not to crash)"

    "Utilizing reduced vocabularies in models consistently yields superior F1 scores compared to their counterparts with larger, less focused vocabularies. Beyond a certain threshold, the F1 score exhibits a discernible decline as vocabulary size expands. This trend is vividly illustrated in the logarithmic graph depicting the relationship between log-transformed vocabulary size and F1 score, underscoring the significance of vocabulary curation in enhancing model performance."

    "TfIdf talks about the ratio of term frequency to document frequency where Count Vectorizer just talks about term frequency. This ratio in TfIdf allows for relative weighting of the terms relative to how much they show up in the entire document. In order to improve the results of my model, I would need to find a way to make sure that not only the longest documents had the highest R scores. The longer a document, the more words will show up and so the larger the numerator of the R score will be and therefore the larger the R value. To accomplish this, I can chop the length of all of my documents to be under a certain value. "

    "In this project, I worked with newsgroup text data to categorize posts by topics, employing various models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, optimizing them for f1 scores. Notably, the choice of Minkowski distance in k-Nearest Neighbors affected its performance, suggesting the use of cosine similarity for text data. Logistic Regression's behavior was tied to the regularization parameter, impacting feature selection. Smaller, focused vocabularies consistently improved F1 scores, and vocabulary size showed a non-linear relationship with performance. Additionally, Tf-Idf and Count Vectorizer were compared, highlighting their differences. Addressing document length bias was proposed, showing promising results in mitigating length-based effects. These findings offer valuable insights for text data classification and model optimization. Through this project, I learned the importance of feature selection, model parameter tuning, and the need to account for inherent biases in text data to build robust classifiers."
