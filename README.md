# Text Classification Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Text Classification Project! This project involves working with text data from newsgroup posts that cover various topics. The primary goal is to develop classifiers capable of categorizing these posts based on the topics inferred from the text content.

## Project Overview

Unlike traditional digit classification tasks, where each input is a relatively dense 28x28 pixel matrix with many non-zero values, text data presents a different challenge. In this project, each document is represented as a "bag-of-words," where only a small subset of words from the entire vocabulary is active in any given document. The assumption underlying this approach is that the topic label depends solely on the count of words in the document, not their order.

## Objectives

- Train powerful classifiers for text classification.
- Explore feature extraction techniques to effectively work with text data.
- Develop a deep understanding of text analysis and classification.

## Get Started

To get started with this project, you can:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the code and notebooks provided.
3. Refer to the documentation on feature extraction in `sklearn` [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html) for in-depth information on this crucial aspect of the project.
